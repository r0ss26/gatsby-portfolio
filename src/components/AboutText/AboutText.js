        <p>
          I am a software developer based in Sydney, 
          Australia with industry experience building 
          innovative full-stack web applications. I have 
          a passion for solving interesting
          problems with code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy using code to build solutions, solve problems and be creative.
          Utilising whichever language, stack or framework is best for the job.
